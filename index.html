    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        This project objective is to design a Mission-Driven Predictive Model Selection that will output a generated predictive model from mission
        scenerio data to predict maintenance that will possibly be needed for an aircraft. The company we will be cooperating with is AVX Aircraft Company, 
        who will be providing three years worth of mission scenerio data. The dataset will contain maintenance records, Aircraft (tail number), Date, Flight 
        hours, Mission Type, and Environment. Python will be used for creating predict models and will implement an agile development cycle.
